1. Data domain and visualization technique

Stock market is always the most existing wonderland for adventurers. There, entrepreneurs come with craziest ideas and agile investors seek and seize any chance to maximize their profits. Everyday, a large scale of predator-prey game happens in the stock market and the price of a stock fluctuates widely with the general expectation of investors. The more positive investors feel about the business, the higher the price of the stock is. So, having an effective visualization tool to depict the general trend of the stock exchange price as well as volume is of great sense to both average investors and analysts.

So my story here is quite simple. I'd like to have a powerful tool to display the daily prices of different stocks, being able to depict both the long-term and short-term trend of each stock. Since the transaction data of stocks are extremely large and trivial for some of them, it is always a headache for investors as well as analysts. So, it might be helpful to have an interactive visualization save us from tons of meaningless details. Basically, it's like the candlestick chart, which stresses out the high, low, open, and close prices of stocks and reflects the trend of the price over time.
